# AlexaSwitch

Amazon Alexa support for ESP8266 and ESP32 devices.

This is a library for ESP8266/ESP32-based devices that emulates Wemos Devices and thus allows you to control them using this protocol, in particular from Alexa-powered devices like the Amazon Echo or the Dot

I tried using the FAUXMOesp Library but unfortunately the devices were not being discoverd on the 2nd gen ECHO Device so after a lot of research and digging found the working code. It's bit more compilcated when adding new devices compared to Fauxmo. Until the issue in fixed this is workaround to get it up and running
